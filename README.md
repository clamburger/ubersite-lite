# Ãœbersite Lite

An internal website designed for use on [&Uuml;bertweak](http://ubertweak.org.au) and [related camps](http://crutech.org.au).

This is the lite version which comes with the bare minimum functionality to make the questionnaire work.

## Requirements

* A web server with `mod_rewrite` (or compatible extension) enabled. Apache 2.2 or above is highly recommended.
* PHP 5.5 or higher.
* PDO and the SQLite3 driver must be available.

## Installation

Very little setup is required; just drag the files into a directory of your choice and go. Note that
at this time, from the web browser perspective, the files must be in the domain root. Whether you
accomplish this by setting by a vhost or simply placing the files in the webserver root is up to
you.

Once you've copied the files, open the site in the browser and you'll be greeted with a very short
setup process which will create the database for you. Users can then be imported using the script
located at [scripts/import-users.php](scripts/import-users.php).

## The Questionnaire

There is [additional documentation](docs/questionnaire.md) available for the questionnaire setup.
